# ACs-Portfolio-is-ACE

## Introducing my first website showcasing my portfolio

### What was my motivation?
I need to showcase what I have learnt and build a website with %100 of my own code.

### What did I do?

Review all the materials from the past 2 weeks of coding bootcamp and try to put it all to use to build my own website to showcase my portfolio. 
	
### What did I learn?

That refactoring code is one thing but having to build your own website from scratch is totally another story. You have to have a clear mind of what you want to create beforehand and a lot of trial and error is involved to get everything working and looking as you wish
